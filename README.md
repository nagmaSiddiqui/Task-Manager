# Task-Manager
This repo is about a Task Manager which allows users to add, view, edit, and delete tasks. Users can provide a title, description, and due date for each task. The app displays tasks in a list and includes a responsive design, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices. Tasks are saved in local storage.
